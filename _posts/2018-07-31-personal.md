I am a PhD student in the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego, working with [Piotr Winkleman, PhD](http://psy2.ucsd.edu/~pwinkiel/). Previously, I worked as a clinical research assistant at [McLean Hospital](http://cdasr.mclean.harvard.edu/) with [Poornima Kumar, PhD](https://cdasr.mclean.harvard.edu/kumar/), [Alexis Whitton, PhD](https://alexiswhitton.org/), and [Diego Pizzagalli, PhD](https://cdasr.mclean.harvard.edu/pizzagalli/). Starting from my research journey at [Bryn Mawr College](http://athapar.blogs.brynmawr.edu/student-research/) (15'), I have developed an interest in computational modeling approach to study reinforcement learning and social cognition, and how these processes interact could inform social decision-making.

I'm originally from [Shenzhen (China)](https://youtu.be/04rYFwZ5uqA) (actually weather-wise San Diego is a lot like my hometown), so I try to take advantage of everything the East Coast and West Coast could offer. When I'm not sitting (playing Dota2 or whatever) in front of a computer, you're likely to find me hanging out with the seals at La Jolla Cove, playing badminton, trying exotic food and chilling with friends.

Favorite TV shows: Black Mirror, Silicon Valley, The Good Fight, Game of Thrones, Criminal Minds, Bones...
