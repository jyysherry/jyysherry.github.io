I am a PhD student in the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego, working with [Piotr Winkleman, PhD](http://psy2.ucsd.edu/~pwinkiel/). Previously, I worked as a clinical research assistant at [McLean Hospital](http://cdasr.mclean.harvard.edu/) with [Poornima Kumar, PhD](https://cdasr.mclean.harvard.edu/kumar/), [Alexis Whitton, PhD](https://alexiswhitton.org/), and [Diego Pizzagalli, PhD](https://cdasr.mclean.harvard.edu/pizzagalli/). Starting from my research journey at McLean, I have developed an interest in studying the relationship between affect and decision making, in both healthy and clinical (i.e., mood disorders including depression and anxiety) populations. My other research interests include social influence, moral decision making, social networks and computational social science. If you are interested in chatting about research, technology or other things (anything really), feel free to shoot me a message. :)

When I'm not sitting in my office in McGill, you're likely to find me hanging out with the seals at La Jolla Cove, trying out different exercise routines, eating exotic food and traveling.
