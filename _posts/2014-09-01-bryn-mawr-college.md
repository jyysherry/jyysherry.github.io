#### Projects (Biology and Psychology)

- The decision processes underlying memory performance (Cognitive Psychology)

- The evolutionary genetics of yeast (Bioinformatics)


#### Research Experience

- Fitted the diffusion model on item memory recognition task performance among 30 high medial temporal lobe (MTL) functioning adults and 30 low MTL functioning adults.
- Compared model fitting of HDDM and fast-dm methods using cumulative density functions, linear regression and parameter recovery analysis.
- Performed genetic variation analysis on large-scale DNA sequencing data of a yeast pathogen Candida Glabrata and described the genetic polymorphisms across the entire genome using bioinformatics tools.
- Quantified the population structure of the same species by using a distance-based multivariate technique, multidimensional scaling as well as creating a phylogenetic tree of the sequenced strains.
- Developed a pipeline for genome analysis with bioinformatics programs and computer clusters.
