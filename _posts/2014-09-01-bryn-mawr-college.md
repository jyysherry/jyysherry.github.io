#### Undergraduate Theses (Biology and Psychology)

- The decision processes underlying memory performance (Cognitive Psychology)

- The evolutionary genetics of yeast (Bioinformatics)


#### Research Experience

- Used the drift diffusion model to compare the difference in item memory recognition task performance between high medial temporal lobe (MTL) functioning adults and low MTL functioning adults.
- Performed genetic variation analysis on large-scale DNA sequencing data of a yeast pathogen *Candida Glabrata*. Quantified the population structure of the same species by using a distance-based multivariate technique, multidimensional scaling as well as creating a phylogenetic tree of the sequenced strains.
