title: Reinforcement Learning in Depression
excerpt: DDepression is characterized by decision-making deficits. Under an emerging reinforcement learning (RL) framework, decision-making is categorized as model-free if responses are habitual (i.e., they rely on previously reinforced actions), or model-based if responses are goal-directed (i.e., they depend on the consideration of future actions and their consequent outcomes).
